# Number Theory App - Final Walkthrough

The **Number Theory** mobile app is now a fully functional education and exploration tool. I have implemented all the core features outlined in the implementation plan, following the premium setup patterns of the `cric-score` project.

## Completed Features

### 1. Modular Playground (Animated)
*   **Visualization**: Beautiful star patterns generated by modular multiplication.
*   **Interactivity**: Real-time adjustment of points ($n$) and multiplier ($k$).
*   **Auto-Animation**: A new "Play" toggle in the header that automatically cycles through multipliers, revealing the fluid transformation of mathematical symmetries.

### 2. Number Theory Toolbox
*   **GCD Solver**: Uses the Euclidean Algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor, displaying every step of the calculation ($a = bq + r$).
*   **Primality Checker**: Instantly checks if a number is prime and provides a full prime factorization if it's composite.

### 3. Ulam Spiral Visualizer
*   **Discovery**: Visualizes the distribution of prime numbers in a square spiral.
*   **Performance**: Optimized to handle up to 2000 points smoothly on mobile devices.
*   **Context**: Includes an educational description of why the spiral reveals diagonal patterns in mathematics.

## Technical Implementation Details
*   **Math Logic**: Robust utilities in `src/utils/math.ts` for GCD, Primality, and spiral coordinates.
*   **Navigation**: Structured `AppNavigator` with types and cross-screen functionality.
*   **Styling**: Premium dark theme using NativeWind and deep slate/sky blue color palette.

## Next Steps
The app is ready for user exploration. Future enhancements could include:
*   **Exporting Images**: Allowing users to save the beautiful patterns generated in the visualizers.
*   **More Advanced Solvers**: Chinese Remainder Theorem, Modular Inverse, and RSA-related tools.
